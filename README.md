# Personality-prediction-using-handwritting-analysis-through-CNN
The prediction of personality traits through handwriting analysis is done by the Graphologist. The famous methodology of doing this analysis is commonly known as Graphology. The prediction of personality traits using handwriting depends upon how much the graphologist is efficient in doing so. The development of computer based handwriting analysis algorithm can make a great impact in predicting the personality traits. In this paper, we are going to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the five big personality traits (Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Neuroticism, Openness) of the writer at the time of writing.
